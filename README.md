HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
This project is an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI and Excel/CSV data to help organizations analyze employee data, attrition trends, income distribution, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics.
2.Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
3.Data Source:
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains HR employee data including demographics, job roles, income, satisfaction levels, and attrition information for workforce analysis.
4. Problems Faced & Solutions
1️⃣ Raw Data Was Unstructured & Inconsistent
Example: Employee data contained inconsistent formats, missing values, and unnecessary columns and there 
Solution is Cleaned and transformed data using Power BI Power Query and Excel to standardize formats and remove irrelevant fields.
2️⃣Lack of High-Level HR Performance Metrics
Problem: No quick view of key HR KPIs like attrition rate, job satisfaction, and total employees.
Solution: Designed KPI cards for instant insights at a glance.
